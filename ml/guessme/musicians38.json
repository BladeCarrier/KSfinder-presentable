The largest religious group is Protestant. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA), in 2010 the Jacksonville metropolitan area had an estimated 365,267 Evangelical Protestants, 76,100 Mainline Protestants, and 56,769 Black Protestants, though figures for the latter were incomplete. There were around 1200 Protestant congregations in various denominations.[70] Notable Protestant churches include Bethel Baptist Institutional Church and First Baptist Church, the city's oldest Baptist churches. The Episcopal Diocese of Florida has its see at St. John's Cathedral, the current building dating to 1906.\nJacksonville is part of the Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine, which covers seventeen counties in North Florida.[71] ARDA estimated 133,155 Catholics attending 25 parishes in the Jacksonville metropolitan area in 2010.[70] One notable Catholic church in Jacksonville is the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, a minor basilica added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.[72][73] There are also two Eastern Catholic parishes, one of the Syriac Catholic Church and one of the Maronite Church.[74] According to ARDA, in 2010 there were 2520 Eastern Orthodox Christians representing four churches in the Eastern Orthodox communion, as well as congregations of Syriac Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Ethiopian Orthodox, and Coptic Orthodox Christians.[70]\nARDA also estimated 14,886 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and 511 Unitarian Universalists in 2010.[70] There were an estimated 8,581 Muslims attending seven mosques, the largest being the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida.[70][75] The Jewish community, which numbered 6,028 in 2010,[70] is largely centered in the neighborhood of Mandarin.[76] There are five Orthodox, two Reform, two Conservative, and one Reconstructionist synagogues. The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute teaches courses for the community.[70][77]\nARDA also estimated 4,595 Hindus, 3,530 Buddhists and 650 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in the Jacksonville area in 2010.[70]\nEconomy[edit]\nFor more details on this topic, see List of companies based in the Jacksonville area.\nCSX Transportation\nEverBank Plaza and Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Florida\nJacksonville's location on the St. Johns River and the Atlantic Ocean proved providential in the growth of the city and its industry. Jacksonville has the largest deepwater port in the South (as well as the second-largest port on the U.S. East coast) and a leading port in the U.S. for automobile imports, as well as the leading transportation and distribution hub in the state.

The Duval County-Jacksonville consolidation eliminated any type of separate county executive or legislature, and supplanted these positions with the Mayor of Jacksonville and the City Council of the City of Jacksonville, respectively. Because of this, voters who live outside of the city limits of Jacksonville but inside Duval County are allowed to vote in elections for these positions and to run for them. In fact, in 1995, John Delaney, a resident of Neptune Beach, was elected mayor of the city of Jacksonville.\nThe St. James Building, currently housing Jacksonville City Hall.\nJacksonville uses the Mayor-Council form of city government, also called the Strong-Mayor form, in which a mayor serves as the city's Chief Executive and Administrative officer.

The current mayor is Lenny Curry, who assumed office on July 1, 2015.[123] The past mayor was Alvin Brown.[124]\nJacksonville and Duval County historically maintained separate police agencies: the Jacksonville Police Department and Duval County Sheriff's Office. As part of consolidation in 1968, the two merged, creating the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO).

The county's murder rate had been the highest among Florida's counties with a population of 500,000 or more for eleven years in 2009, leading to widespread discussion in the community about how to deal with the problem. In 2010 Duval County's violent crime rate decreased by 9.3% from the previous year, with total crime decreasing 7.3%, putting the murder rate behind that of Miami-Dade County.[125]\nSome government services remained \u2014 as they had been before consolidation \u2013 independent of both city and county authority. In accordance with Florida law, the school board continues to exist with nearly complete autonomy. Jacksonville also has several quasi-independent government agencies which only nominally answer to the consolidated authority, including electric authority, port authority, transportation authority, housing authority and airport authority. The main environmental and agricultural body is the Duval County Soil and Water Conservation District, which works closely with other area and state agencies.\nFederally, most of the city is in the 4th district, represented by Republican Ander Crenshaw.

Additionally, Nemours Children's Clinic and Mayo Clinic Hospital each draw patients regionally.\nHousing[edit]\nThe Jacksonville Housing Authority (JHA) is the quasi-independent agency responsible for public housing and subsidized housing in Jacksonville. The Mayor and City Council of Jacksonville established the JHA in 1994 to create an effective, community service oriented, public housing agency with innovative ideas and a different attitude. The primary goal was to provide safe, clean, affordable housing for eligible low and moderate income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. The secondary goal was to provide effective social services, work with residents to improve their quality of life, encourage employment and self-sufficiency, and help residents move out of assisted housing. To that end, JHA works with HabiJax to help low and moderate income families to escape the public housing cycle and become successful, productive, homeowners and taxpayers.\nNon-profit/service organizations[edit]\nFor more details on this topic, see List of non-profit organizations in Jacksonville, Florida.\nThe TaxExemptWorld.com website, which compiles Internal Revenue Service data, reported that in 2007, there are 2,910 distinct, active, tax exempt/non-profit organizations in Jacksonville which, excluding Credit Unions, had a total income of $7.08 billion and assets of $9.54 billion.[144] There are 333 charitable organizations with assets of over $1 million. The largest share of assets was tied to Medical facilities, $4.5 billion. The problems of the homeless are addressed by several non-profits, most notably the Sulzbacher Center and the Clara White Mission.\nUtilities[edit]\nJEA Northside Generating Station\nBasic utilities in Jacksonville (water, sewer, electric) are provided by JEA (formerly the Jacksonville Electric Authority). According to Article 21 of the Jacksonville City Charter,\n\"JEA is authorized to own, manage and operate a utilities system within and outside the City of Jacksonville. JEA is created for the express purpose of acquiring, constructing, operating, financing and otherwise have plenary authority with respect to electric, water, sewer, natural gas and such other utility systems as may be under its control now or in the future.\"[145]\nPeople's Gas is Jacksonville's natural gas provider.\nComcast is Jacksonville's local cable provider.\nAT&T (formerly BellSouth) is Jacksonville's local phone provider, and their U-Verse service offers TV, internet, and VoIP phone service to customers served by fiber-to-the-premises or fiber-to-the-node using a VRAD.\nThe city has a successful recycling program with separate pickups for garbage, yard waste and recycling. Collection is provided by several private companies under contract to the City of Jacksonville.\nTransportation[edit]\nMain article: Transportation in Jacksonville, Florida\nP-3 Orion aircraft from NAS Jacksonville overfly downtown Jacksonville and three of its road bridges, 1994. The Fuller Warren drawbridge in the foreground has since been torn down and replaced by a higher span.\nJacksonville Skyway\nJTA Bus Route K2\nJacksonville International Airport\nRail transportation[edit]\nMain article: Jacksonville Skyway\nThe Jacksonville Skyway is an automated people mover connecting Florida State College at Jacksonville downtown campus, the Northbank central business district, Convention Center, and Southbank locations. The system includes 8 stops connected by two lines. The existing train is a UMIII monorail built by Bombardier. The guideway consists of concrete beams which rest atop an unusually large support structure not used in most monorail systems. Maximum speed for the train is 48 km/h (30 mph).[146]\nA monorail was first proposed in the 1970s as part of a mobility plan hoping to attract interest from the Urban Mass Transit Administration's Downtown Peoplemover Program. The initial study was undertaken by the Florida Department of Transportation and Jacksonville's planning department, who took the Skyway project to the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) in 1977. Following further development and a final 18-month feasibility study, the UMTA selected Jacksonville as one of seven cities to receive federal funding for an automated people mover. Two other related projects are Miami's Metromover and Detroit's People Mover. UMTA's approved plan called for the construction of a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) Phase I system to be built in three segments.\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides daily service from the Jacksonville Amtrak Station on Clifford Lane in the northwest section of the city. Two trains presently stop there, the Silver Meteor and Silver Star. Jacksonville was also served by the thrice-weekly Sunset Limited and the daily Silver Palm. Service on the Silver Palm was cut back to Savannah, Georgia in 2002. The Sunset Limited route was truncated at San Antonio, Texas as a result of the track damage in the Gulf Coast area caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 28, 2005. Service was restored as far east as New Orleans by late October 2005, but Amtrak has opted not to fully restore service into Florida.\nJacksonville is the headquarters of two significant freight railroads. CSX Transportation, owns a large building on the downtown riverbank that is a significant part of the skyline. Florida East Coast Railway also calls Jacksonville home.\nAir transportation[edit]\nJacksonville is served by Jacksonville International Airport (IATA: JAX, ICAO: KJAX, FAA LID: JAX), 13 miles north of downtown, with 82 departures a day to 27 nonstop destination cities. Airports in Jacksonville are managed by the Jacksonville Aviation Authority (JAA). Smaller aircraft use Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport (IATA: CRG, ICAO: KCRG, FAA LID: CRG) in Arlington, Herlong Recreational Airport (ICAO: KHEG, FAA LID: HEG) on the Westside, and Cecil Airport (IATA: VQQ, ICAO: KVQQ, FAA LID: VQQ), at Cecil Commerce Center. The state of Florida has designated Cecil Airport a space port, allowing horizontal lift spacecraft to use the facility.\nSeaports[edit]\nPublic seaports in Jacksonville are managed by the Jacksonville Port Authority, known as JAXPORT. Four modern deepwater (38 ft) seaport facilities, including America's newest cruise port, make Jacksonville a full-service international seaport. In FY2006, JAXPORT handled 8.7 million tons of cargo, including nearly 610,000 vehicles, which ranks Jacksonville 2nd in the nation in automobile handling, behind only the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[147]\nThe 20 other maritime facilities not managed by the Port Authority move about 10 million tons of additional cargo in and out of the St. Johns River. In terms of total tonnage, the Port of Jacksonville ranks 40th nationally; within Florida, it is 3rd behind Tampa and Port Everglades.\nIn 2003, the JAXPORT Cruise Terminal opened, providing cruise service for 1,500 passengers to Key West, Florida, the Bahamas, and Mexico via Carnival Cruise Lines ship, Celebration, which was retired in April 2008. For almost five months, no cruises originated from Jacksonville until September 20, 2008, when the cruise ship Fascination departed with 2,079 passengers.[148] In Fiscal year 2006, there were 78 cruise ship sailings with 128,745 passengers.[149] A JaxPort spokesperson said in 2008 that they expect 170,000 passengers to sail each year.[150]\nJacksonville Fire and Rescue operates a fleet of three fireboats.[151] Its vessels are called on to fight approximately 75 fires per year.[152]\nFreeways and highways[edit]\nSeveral regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on Jacksonville freeways. A $152 million project to create a high-speed interchange at the intersection of Interstates 10 and 95 began in February 2005, after the conclusion of Super Bowl XXXIX. Construction was expected to take nearly six years with multiple lane flyovers and the requirement that the interchange remain open throughout the project. The previous configuration utilized single lane, low speed, curved ramps which created backups during rush hours and contributed to accidents.[153] Also, construction of 9B, future Interstate 795 (Florida), is currently underway (July 2013).\nInterstates[edit]\nI-95 going through downtown Jacksonville\nInterstate Highways 10 and 95 intersect in Jacksonville, forming the busiest intersection in the region with 200,000 vehicles each day.[154] Interstate 10 ends at this intersection (the other end being in Santa Monica, California). Additionally, State Road 202 (J. Turner Butler Boulevard) connects Jacksonville to the beaches. Interstate 95 has a bypass route, with I-295, which encircles the downtown area. The major interchange at I-295 and SR 202 (Butler Blvd) was finally completed on December 24, 2008. SR 9B is underway and will connect I-295's southeast corner to the Bayard Area.[155]\nInterstate 10\nInterstate 95\nInterstate 295\nMajor highways[edit]\nUS 1 and US 17 travel through the city from the south to the north, and US 23 enters the city concurrent with US 1. In downtown, US 23 splits from US 1 and quickly runs to its southern terminus. The eastern terminus of US 90 is in nearby Jacksonville Beach near the Atlantic Ocean. U.S. 23 other end is in Mackinaw City, Michigan.\nU.S. Route 1\nU.S. Route 17\nU.S. Route 23\nU.S. Route 90\nU.S. Route 301\nBridges[edit]\nThere are seven bridges over the St. Johns River at Jacksonville. They include (starting from furthest downstream) the Napoleon Bonaparte Broward Bridge (Dames Point) (which carries Interstate 295 Eastern Beltway traffic), the John E. Mathews Bridge, the Isaiah D. Hart Bridge, the John T. Alsop Jr. Bridge (Main Street), the St. Elmo W. Acosta Bridge, the Fuller Warren Bridge (which carries I-95 traffic) and the Henry Holland Buckman Bridge (which carries I-295 North/South traffic). Also, next to the Acosta Bridge is a large jackknife railroad bridge built in the 1920s by Henry flagler's FEC railroad.\nBeginning in 1953, tolls were charged on the Hart, Mathews, Fuller Warren and the Main Street bridges to pay for bridge construction, renovations and many other highway projects. As Jacksonville grew, toll plazas created bottlenecks and caused delays and accidents during rush hours. In 1988, Jacksonville voters chose to eliminate toll collection and replace the revenue with a \u00bd cent local sales tax increase. In 1989, the toll booths were removed.\nThe Mayport Ferry connects the north and south ends of State Road A1A between Mayport and Fort George Island, and is the last active ferry in Florida. The state of Florida transferred responsibility for ferry operations to JAXPORT on October 1, 2007.\nA 1992 map of downtown Jacksonville showing three road bridges.\nAcosta Bridge\nMathews Bridge\nFuller Warren Bridge\nMain St Bridge\nHart Bridge\nDames Point Bridge\nBuckman Bridge\n[show]\nv t e\nSt. Johns River crossings in the Jacksonville, Florida area\nNotable people[edit]\nMain article: List of people from Jacksonville, Florida\nSister cities[edit]\nSee also: List of sister cities in Florida\nJacksonville has eight sister cities.[156] They are:\n- Bah\u00eda Blanca, Argentina (since 1967)\n- Murmansk, Russia (1975)\n- Changwon, South Korea (1983)\n- Nantes, France (1984)\n- Yingkou, Liaoning, People's Republic of China (1990)\n- Port Elizabeth/Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa (2000)\n- Curitiba, Brazil (2009)\n- San Juan, Puerto Rico (2009)\nIn 2000, The Sister Cities International awarded Jacksonville the Innovation Arts & Culture Award for the city's program with Nantes.\nSee also[edit]\nFlorida portal Jacksonville portal\nDuval County, Florida\nGreater Jacksonville\nList of people from Jacksonville, Florida\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Duval County, Florida\nNotes[edit]\n^ Official records for Jacksonville were kept at downtown from September 1871 to December 1955, Imeson Field from 1 January 1956 to 18 January 1971, and at Jacksonville Int'l since 19 January 1971.
