As defined by the IEEE standards body, electronic devices are low-power systems and use components such as transistors and integrated circuits. Working from this definition, distinction can be made between instruments that produce sound through electromechanical means as opposed to instruments that produce sound using electronic components. Examples of an electromechanical instrument are the teleharmonium, the Hammond B3 organ, and the electric guitar, whereas examples of an electronic instrument are a Theremin, synthesizer, and a computer.\nMore about electronic music...\nedit  \nSelected genre\nTechno\nStylistic origins Synthpop\nElectro\nChicago house\nHouse music\nElectronic body music\nCultural origins Mid-1980s,\nDetroit, United States\nTypical instruments Synthesizer, keyboards, sampler, drum machine, sequencer, personal computer\nSubgenres\nAcid techno, Ambient techno, Tekkno, Minimal techno, Tech house\n(complete list)\nFusion genres\nDigital hardcore, Electroclash, Eurodance, Ghettotech, IDM, Techstep, Techstyle, Tech Trance\nRegional scenes\nDetroit techno, Freetekno, Nortec, Schranz\nOther topics\nElectronic musical instrument \u2013 computer music \u2013 record labels \u2013 raves \u2013 free party\u2013teknival\nTechno is a form of electronic dance music (EDM) that emerged in Detroit, Michigan in the United States during the mid to late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word techno in reference to a genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built.\nThe initial take on techno arose from the melding of electronic music, in the style of artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra, with African American music styles, including funk, electro, Chicago house and electric jazz. Added to this is the influence of futuristic and fictional themes relevant to life in American latecapitalist society, with Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave being a notable point of reference. Pioneering producer Juan Atkins cites Toffler's phrase \"techno rebels\" as inspiring him to use the word techno to describe the musical style he helped to create. This unique blend of influences aligns techno with the aesthetic referred to as afrofuturism. To producers such as Derrick May, the transference of spirit from the body to the machine is often a central preoccupation; essentially an expression of technological spirituality. In this manner: \"techno dance music defeats whatAdorno saw as the alienating effect of mechanisation on the modern consciousness\".\nStylistically, techno is generally repetitive instrumental music produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythmic component is most often in common time (4/4), where time is marked with a bass drum on each quarter note pulse, a backbeat played by snare or clap on the second and fourth pulses of the bar, and an open hi-hat sounding every second eighth note. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 beats per minute (quarter note equals 120 pulses per minute) and 150 bpm, depending on the style of techno.\nThe creative use of music production technology, such as drum machines, synthesizers, and digital audio workstations, is viewed as an important aspect of the music's aesthetic. Many producers use retro electronic musical devices to create what they consider to be an authentic techno sound. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro technology are popular among techno producers.\nMusic journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term; so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance. \"Techno\" is also commonly confused with generalized descriptors, such as electronic music and electronic dance music.\nMore about Techno..\nedit  \nSelected biography\nKraftwerk (pronounced [\u02c8k\u0281aftv\u025b\u0250k], German for \"power plant\") is a German musical group who have made significant contributions to the development of experimental and electronic music. The band was founded by Florian Schneider-Esleben and Ralf H\u00fctter in 1970, but became widely known as a quartet consisting of Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr and Karl Bartos alongside the founding members.\nThe techniques Kraftwerk introduced, together with the equipment they adopted, are now commonplace in modern music. They have been a major influence on the popular music of the end of the 20th century, often considered of comparable status to The Beatles.\nMore about Kraftwerk...\nedit  \nSelected picture\nKarlheinz Stockhausen one of the earliest composers of purely electronic music.\n\nedit  \nElectronic music news\n\nLatest news about electronic music from Google News\nedit  \nQuotes\n\"Somebody will ask those of us who compose with the aid of computers: 'So you make all these decisions for the computer or the electronic medium, but wouldn't you like to have a performer who makes certain other decisions?' Many composers don't mind collaborating with the performer with regards to decisions of tempo, or rhythm, or dynamics, or timbre, but ask them if they would allow the performer to make decisions with regard to pitch and the answer will be 'Pitches you don't change.' Some of us feel the same way in regard to the other musical aspects that are traditionally considered secondary, but which we consider fundamental. As for the future of electronic music, it seems quite obvious to me that its unique resources guarantee its use, because it has shifted the boundaries of music away from the limitations of the acoustical instrument, of the performer's coordinating capabilities, to the almost infinite limitations of the electronic instrument. The new limitations are the human ones of perception.\"\nMilton Babbitt, quoted in Classic Essays on Twentieth-Century Music, ISBN 0028645812\nedit  \nFeatured articles\nThe KLF\n1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)\n\"All You Need Is Love\"\n\"Fuck the Millennium\"\nSasha (DJ)\nList of FA-Class electronic music articles...\nedit  \nElectronic music topics\nElectronic music\nAmbient Breakbeat Drum and bass Dubstep Electro Eurodance Hardcore Hi-NRG House Industrial Synthpop Techno Trance Trip hop UK garage\nList of 150 genres of electronic music see...\nedit  \nCategories\nTo display all subcategories click on the [+]\n\u25bc Electronic music\n\u25ba Electronic albums\n\u25ba Electronic compositions\n\u25ba Computer music\n\u25ba Electronic music discographies\n\u25ba DJing\n\u25ba Electronic music festivals\n\u25ba Electronic music films\n\u25ba Electronic music genres\n\u25ba Graphical sound\n\u25ba Electronic musical instruments\n\u25ba Live coding\n\u25ba Music software\n\u25ba Electronic musicians\n\u25ba Electronic music organizations\n\u25ba Rave\n\u25ba Sampling\n\u25ba Electronic music software\n\u25ba Electronic songs\n\u25ba Spatialization\n\u25ba Electronic music stubs\nedit  \nElectronic music WikiProject\nWikiProject\nProject page talk\nAssessment\nRecent changes\nMain articles\nArticle quality\nMedia\nThe Electronic music WikiProject is a project that helps to assemble writers and editors interested in Electronic music related articles.\nThe aim of this project is to standardize and improve articles related to Electronic music, as well as to create missing articles.\nTo become a member of this WikiProject (anyone may join), simply click here - and add {{user|username}}.\n FA   A   GA   B   C   Start   Stub   FL   List   Book   Category   Portal   Project   Template   NA   ???
