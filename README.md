# KS classifier

This branch holds a single notebook that tackles the K0s event classification problem mentioned in the Voronovo speech.

The main notebook can be found [here]"https://github.com/yandexdataschool/KSfinder/blob/identification/signal_vs_bg.ipynb"

The repo obviously lacks data (which is 22 ~ 130 GB of compressed stuff), so if you want to get it running, go ping us (lambda or me jheuristic@yandex-team.ru) via e-mail.
